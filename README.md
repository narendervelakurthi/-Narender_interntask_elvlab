# Basic Vulnerability Scan - Task 3

## üìå Objective
Perform a vulnerability scan on my PC using Nessus Essentials, identify security issues, and document findings with remediation steps.

---

## üõ† Tools Used
- **Nessus Essentials** (Free edition from Tenable)
- **Operating System:** Windows

---

## üîç Steps Followed
1. **Installed Vulnerability Scanner**
   - Downloaded Nessus Essentials from [Tenable](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials)
   - Activated using a free license key (Nessus).

2. **Configured Scan Target**
   - Found local IP using `ipconfig` (Windows).
   - Set my PC's IP address as the target in the scanner.

3. **Ran Full Vulnerability Scan**
   - Duration: ~40‚Äì60 minutes.
   - Avoided interrupting the scan.

4. **Reviewed Results**
   - Checked vulnerabilities by severity: Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info.

5. **Researched Fixes**
   - Searched CVEs and vendor recommendations for remediation.

6. **Documented Findings**
   - Took screenshots and recorded top vulnerabilities with fixes.

## ‚ö† Key Findings & Fixes

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Critical ‚Äì Outdated Software Component
- **Description:** Nessus detected a software package that is outdated and has known critical security vulnerabilities.
- **Risk:** Could allow remote code execution if exploited.
- **Fix:**
  - Update the affected software to the latest vendor-released version.
  - Check vendor security advisories for relevant patches.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ High ‚Äì SMB Signing Disabled
- **Description:** SMB protocol signing is not enforced, allowing man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- **Risk:** An attacker could intercept SMB traffic and modify data.
- **Fix:**
  - Enable SMB signing in Windows Group Policy:
    - Run `gpedit.msc`
    - Navigate to: **Computer Configuration ‚Üí Windows Settings ‚Üí Security Settings ‚Üí Local Policies ‚Üí Security Options**
    - Enable **"Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always)"**.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Medium ‚Äì Weak TLS Configuration
- **Description:** System supports outdated TLS versions (TLS 1.0/1.1).
- **Risk:** Vulnerable to downgrade attacks.
- **Fix:**
  - Disable TLS 1.0/1.1 in system or web server settings.
  - Ensure TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3 is enforced.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Medium ‚Äì Outdated OpenSSL Library
- **Description:** OpenSSL version is outdated and may allow attackers to execute code remotely.
- **Risk:** High exploitation probability.
- **Fix:** Update OpenSSL to the latest stable release from the official vendor.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Medium ‚Äì Insecure Services Enabled
- **Description:** Certain legacy or unnecessary services are running.
- **Risk:** May be exploited for privilege escalation or lateral movement.
- **Fix:** Disable unused services via **Services.msc** or PowerShell.
