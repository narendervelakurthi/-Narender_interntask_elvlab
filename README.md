## ⚠️ Extension Risks Considered

- Even popular extensions can become unsafe if they request excessive permissions, are sold to untrusted developers, or receive malicious updates.  
- Free “utility” extensions (like boosters, converters, free VPNs) often pose higher risks.

## 🛡️ How Malicious Extensions Harm Users

- **Performance issues:** Slows browser, consumes resources.

## ✅ Recommendations

- **Limit extensions:** Keep only what is essential.

- **Review regularly:** Audit extensions monthly.  
- **Keep updated:** Ensure trusted extensions remain patched.
